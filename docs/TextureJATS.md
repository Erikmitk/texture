This document shows examples for Texture JATS usage. The premise of TextureJATS is to have exactly one tagging style per use-case. E.g. there is only one way to tag a reference, author or affiliation. Additionally we define a set of optional extensions to model reproducible elements (cells) in JATS. This work is inspired but not related to JATS4R, a similar effort to make JATS more reusable.

## Affiliations
